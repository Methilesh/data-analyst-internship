# Data Analytics Internship Projects README

## Project 1: Frog Game Analysis using Python
This project involves analyzing data from a frog game using Python and possibly building predictive models to understand player behavior and improve the game's performance.

## Project 2: Excel Dashboard Creation on Biker Buyer Dataset
The goal of this project is to create an Excel dashboard using the Biker Buyer dataset. The dashboard will provide insights into customer demographics, preferences, and purchasing behavior, aiding decision-making for marketing strategies and product development.

## Project 3: Data Cleaning using Pandas
In this project, interns will gain hands-on experience with data cleaning techniques using the Pandas library in Python. They will learn how to handle missing values, deal with duplicates, and address inconsistencies in datasets, ensuring data quality for downstream analysis.

## Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on India Cars Dataset and Super Sales Dataset
Interns will perform exploratory data analysis on two distinct datasets: the India Cars dataset and the Super Sales dataset. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, they will uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

## Project 5: Mundane Mystery Dataset Analysis using SQL
Interns will work with the Mundane Mystery dataset and utilize SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze the data. This project aims to enhance interns' proficiency in SQL and database management while exploring real-world data analysis scenarios.

## Project 6: Tableau Dashboard Creation on Air Pollution Analysis
This project involves creating a Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze air pollution data. Interns will use Tableau's features to create interactive visualizations that highlight trends, geographic patterns, and potential correlations in air quality metrics.

## Project 7: Capstone Fitbit Consumer Behavior Analysis
Interns will undertake a comprehensive analysis of consumer fitness behavior using Fitbit data. By merging multiple datasets encompassing various time intervals and applying advanced analytical techniques, interns will derive actionable insights to inform decision-making in the fitness and wellness industry.

**Note:** Each project provides an opportunity for interns to apply and enhance their skills in data analytics, visualization, and problem-solving, contributing to their professional development in the field.
